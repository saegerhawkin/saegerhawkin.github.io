# Portfolio Website #
This respository is for holding the code to my portfolio website. This is going to be a source for my projects, some blurbs about me, and links to my social media. Feel free to check it out! The site is hosted on Github, which allows every user to have one free static website. This does mean I cannot add dynamic features like a php contact page so it is built with just HTML and CSS.
